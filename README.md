Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library. In this game, the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to collect as much food as possible without running into the walls or the snake itself.

Features
Control the snake using the W, A, S, and D keys.
The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
Keep track of the current score and the high score.
Game resets upon collision with walls or the snake's body.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Turtle graphics library (usually included with Python installations)
Installation
Clone this repository or download the source code.

Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the project directory.

Run the game using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python snake_game.py
(Replace snake_game.py with the name of your Python file if it's different.)

Controls
W: Move up
S: Move down
A: Move left
D: Move right
Gameplay
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
Collect red circular food to grow the snake and increase your score.
Avoid colliding with the walls of the game window or the snake's own body.
The game will reset if the snake collides with a wall or itself.
